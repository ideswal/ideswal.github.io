Most of the existing literature using this iteration of the ‘mind game’ paradigm relies on utilizing the difference between the expected number of matches per period (given a baseline probability of 16.7% of a match) and the number of matches actually reported by the participant to estimate the degree of dishonesty within or between treatments — a measure we have chosen to call the ‘estimated dishonesty percentage’ (Jiang, 2013). Instead, our experimental design allowed for total accuracy in the calculation of dishonest behavior by logging the actual result of each individual roll in all twenty rounds of the experiment through the Qualtrics platform. This offered an opportunity to measure and utilize a participant’s ‘true’ dishonesty percentage as the dependent variable examined throughout our study.
We’ve defined the true dishonesty percentage as the ratio of observed dishonest decisions (‘lies’) compared to the total number of opportunities to be dishonest in either period (or both). For example, if a participant rolled three 6’s and seven non-6’s in one ten-round period, they had seven total dishonest opportunities. If they reported a total of five matches (rolls that resulted in a 6) throughout the period, they have therefore lied in two of their seven opportunities meaning their true dishonesty is 2/7 or 28.6%. This should theoretically control for any potential variance in our data due to the number of 6’s each subject happens to roll (though we later confirm this through our regression framework as well). The differences between the estimated and true dishonesty percentages for each individual treatment and across all observations are shown below (Figure 1). Notably, we find our mean true dishonesty percentage (14.3%) to be significantly higher than our mean estimated dishonesty percentage (11.5%) when looked at across all 205 observations (p=0.00).
